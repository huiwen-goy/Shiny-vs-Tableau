#### About this project ####
Virginia Tech provides publicly available data from their [bicycle helmet safety](https://www.helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html) studies. There's a search function for brands or models on their website, but it's difficult for a user to explore the available information, especially if their goal is to find a helmet that meets certain safety and cost criteria.  

#### R Shiny vs. Tableau ####

The R Shiny version: [https://huiwen-goy.shinyapps.io/project_shiny_bike/](https://huiwen-goy.shinyapps.io/project_shiny_bike/)  
The Tableau version: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hg8172/viz/Bike_helmet_safety/Dashboard_1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hg8172/viz/Bike_helmet_safety/Dashboard_1)  

Both the R Shiny and Tableau dashboards display Virginia Tech's 2022 edition of bike helmet safety data, with the added ability to filter by manufacturer, safety score, star rating, and cost.  

Making an R Shiny dashboard requires some basic coding skills, while making a Tableau (public version) dashboard does not. R Shiny allows more customization of the layout and aesthetics than Tableau (public). An R Shiny dashboard can run offline on a local computer, while a Tableau dashboard runs online only.
